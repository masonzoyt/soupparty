        A small group of travelers wandered into a village, with only a large pot. Hungry, they asked the villagers to spare with them some food. Feeling
    scarcely-resourced, the residents refused. As the travelers grew hungrier, they also grew up a plan.

        Quickly, they filled the pot with water and began it heating over a fire. The last addition was a large stone. wary, one of the villagers let his 
curiosity reign and asked them what they were doing. The travelers told him, "we're making a delicious stone soup. we'd love to share it with you, but 
it could be a little better with something a little more to really enhance the flavor." The villager, still interested, went back to his house and 
brought them an onion. He said he hoped it could help, and the travelers enthusiastically agreed that it could.

        Watching from inside, another villager walked by and asked what was going on. The travelers told her the same thing they told the other villager, 
    and she too left and came back with some carrots. "it's not a lot, but hopefully it can do something." the travelers told her it would do more 
    than she could imagine. Soon, more and more villagers trickled out of their homes over to the soup-making. As they inquired, they also found the same
    interest in seeing what they could bring.

        The stone soup morphed into the most delicious soup anyone in the village could imagine. The travelers declared it ready, and everyone 
eagerly tried some. They all agreed, yes, it was the most delicious soup they'd had. The evening continued with games and stories and song. In the morning,
the travelers continued their journey. "thank you for having us!" they called, to which the villagers replied, "thank you for showing us how to make 
STONE SOUP!"
